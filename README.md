# Chatbot

Chatbot is an intelligent web-based assistant that leverages AI and real-time web scraping to answer user questions with up-to-date information. It combines the power of OpenAI's GPT model, SerpAPI for search results, and Cheerio for DOM parsingâ€”making it a lightweight but highly effective tool for context-aware web research.

This project showcases skills across:
- AI prompt engineering
- Web scraping and dynamic data parsing
- Message Timestamps: Each message is displayed with the time it was sent, providing clear chronological context to the conversation.
- RESTful API design with Express.js
- Third-party API integrations (OpenAI + SerpAPI)
- Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- Interactive chat interface for seamless user experience.
